The cache, to avoid having a hard limit on size, was made to be a dynamically allocated cache. That is,
when a new request was made, the cache would store a new resource within the cache and on subsequent requests
the response would originate from the randomly populated cache rather than via a disk lookup. The cache had no
policy for dealing with overflow as it was assumed that the number of cached resources would be few enough that the
cache could grow indefinitely. So, for every new request a new cache entry was made, thus avoiding an upper bound.
