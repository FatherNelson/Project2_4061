PROBLEM 1 `em_server_mq.c' and `em_server_mq.c'
===============================================

A
~

  Examine the source code for `em_server_mq.c' and
  `em_client_mq.c'. Describe the lines of code which are used to
  establish the message queues used for communication. How many message
  queues are there?


B
~

  Describe the sending and receiving functions used in the server to put
  messages onto the queue. Focus your attention on the server side
  first. Describe each argument of the send/receive functions and its
  purpose. You may wish to consult the textbook or manual page for the
  functions to get more information.


C
~

  Describe the protocol that appears to be used for communication. What
  steps are taken by a client to make a request for an email address
  lookup? How does the server respond? You may find it useful to use the
  letters associated with print statements like "A" and "D". Note any
  operations that might happen in an arbitrary order.


D
~

  In the Message Queue server/client, potentially many clients are
  accessing the To-Client queue simultaneously. Describe why there is
  not a problem in this setting. Look carefully at the arguments used in
  the `msgrcv()' call in the client.


E
~

  There is NO explicit sleeping in the Message Queue server/client which
  might indicate it is less efficient as processes busily wait for
  messages. Do some research on `msgsnd() / msgrcv()' calls to determine
  if they are busy waiting (polling) or interrupt driven operations.

  Confirm these answers by running `run_simulations_mq.sh' on a large
  number of client and timing the results. A sample run might be
  ,----
  | > time ./run_simulation_mq.sh 1000 > ~/tmp/xxx
  `----
