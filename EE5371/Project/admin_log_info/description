The file named "output.txt" generally has the basic information about the length of the test and the number of
operations that occurred during said test. This "number of operations" is macroscopically defined. For comparisons
between architectures, we avoid delving into the number of cores, but understand that the OS may optimize
so they are minimally included. However, this code is not threaded so it should not be running on more than one core
at a time anyways. We choose to ignore memory accesses, so cache and hard disk do NOT matter, as the data for the
manipulation (unrealistically) is created at run time. A future implementation would also test the memory bandwidth
and this would show favorably on say, euler angles who require less space. Anyways, as a pure performance measure
defined by computational speed, and to devise a linear relationship, we examined closest the CPU and GPU of each device
namely:

CPU
	Name:
	1. Clock Speed
GPU
	Name:
	1. Core Speed (CLOCK)
	2. FP32
	3. FP64
